to use copy ra8876.c and ra8876.h into your project

check out main.c as an example

100% written by opus 4.5, I tested it on ER-TFTM101-1
24 hours running the demos in a loop and no issues so far.

everything is in 8bpp if you want 16 or 24 just download the ra8876.pdf and ask claude to rewrite it
